# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Markdown Instructions


## Existing Design (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.

### Existing Site: The Site (Milestone 1)
> What is your existing site about? Tell us about it.
The site is designed for potential clients or employers who are interested in hiring CS/Info scientists. The site will serve as a resume or further information about me that I will show possible employers. The only thing is this was my first project for 1300 before we knew flexbox or javascript, so as of rn it is missing those components, as seen within my sketches however I plan to incorporate this within the next milestones. However it is important to note that I have completed user interviews, done card sorting and user testing for my site when trying to continue to build it over the summer. This is what lead me to change the intial layout i had with the navigation on the bottom to the top and the change of the page name of "Dive deeper into my mind" to "About Me".

> How and where did you create this site?
I created this site in info 1300 last spring but build upon it last summer a bit after the semester.

> Is this site designed for desktop, mobile devices or both?

desktop

> Explain with this website is a **static** website.

There is no current php and no user input is stored, it has fixed content that does not change or customized for different users.


### Existing Site: Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

Possible future employees searching to hire someone in web development and computer science. This is a cohesive group because they all have the same goal of finding an employee experienced is CS and Webdevlopment.


### Existing Site: Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your existing site's audience's goals. (These should be informed by user research. Not assumptions or stereotypes.)
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Guage my Experience

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - incorporate a page that exihibts my past projects and other accomplishments
  - possibly incorporate a page on past internships or awards recieved
  - a brief discription of classes taken, languages known that show i have experience
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - All the following content incoporations exibits that i have taken many classes and completed many projects using such programing languages that would make me experienced in the programming languages, similarly noting awards i recieved will further demonstrate a good level of understanding and accounatbility.

Goal 2: Interpersonalization

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - headshot of me
  - an about me page
  - hobbies/clubs im in
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - these incorporations allows the employer to put a face and personality behind my name, allowing them to get a better understanding to who they are interviewing in the hiring process.

Goal 3: To contact me

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - include contact information right on the home page
  - mailto mail link and all socials
  - possibly allow for a schedule a meeting option later on
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - wether they found my website through linkdin or from their application form possible employers may want to reach out to me when veiwing my page providing this content allows them to do so.


### Existing Site: Design/Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Sketch your existing site. Include these sketches here.
> **You may not copy your sketches from a previous assignment.**
> Why can't you copy the sketches? I want to get you thinking about the strengths/weaknesses of the current design.
> Provide an explanation _underneath_ each sketch explaining the sketch and any design patterns you are leveraging.

Home page:
![home page layout](/public/images/IMG_5774.JPG)
- this page has the Navigation at the top to make it easier to flow through the site, then my Name and a headshot of me, since it is a personal website i want this to be the first thing a future employee sees. Next there is the about section, known coding languages, background info and contact information. These are all stacked on top of one another and give a quick synopsis of who I am and who they will dicover throughout the website. This was project1 from 1300 and was done before we learned flexbox or other practices, I want my layout to be for a laptop so I would like to change the flex-position of this page, instead of having everything stacked I would like to include things side by side to really take advantage of the space offered.

Communities:
![communities page layout](/public/images/IMG_5777.JPG)
- This page also behins with the navigation bar at the top which uses css hover classes to afford the clickability of the links. Then the clubs i am invovled in and my exracuricular actvities are stacked with a brief paragraph about what each club is. I am hoping to futher this page by
incorporting images of each club, even possibly make it into a modal gallery.

About Me:
![about me page layout](/public/images/IMG_5776.JPG)
- this page begins with the navigation bar at the top that links to the other pages. Then has stacked content with my favorite quote, inspirations (as a list), and then things i enjoy (also a a list). This page is to allow the employer to gain a personal connection to me, attaching an individual behind the name on the application. Again this was project1 from 1300 and was done before we learned flexbox or other practices, I want my layout to be for a laptop so I would like to change the flex-position of this page, instead of having everything stacked I would like to include things side by side to really take advantage of the space offered. I am hopping to also include a carousel of imagess of things i enjoy doing to add a more uplifted mood to my page. When first making the website we hadnt been introduced to javascript, but i want to add that for the upcoming milestones!

projects:
![projects page layout](/public/images/IMG_5775.JPG)
- This page has the Navigation at the top to make it easier to flow through the site, then a list of classes completed by me that would show my level of knowledge grasped at school. My projects done (with either an image or a link to the project) again to futher demonstrate my coding abilities. And an academic achievements list. similar to my home page, this was project1 from 1300 and was done before we learned flexbox or other practices, I want my layout to be for a laptop so I would like to change the flex-position of this page, instead of having everything stacked I would like to include things side by side to really take advantage of the space offered.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions (Milestone 2)
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback

After reviewing the feedback I was given, I havent made any changes except a few athesitic perosonal preference changes. I was told that everything was good and that I was on the right track, and that everything was good as was, so I did not make any revisions specifically in response to milestone 1.
## Refined Design (Milestone 2)

  Say william stumbles upon my website through my Linkdin a goal of william is to be able to get to know me and to find out wether I am a good fit for the company what better way to do this then to chat with me. To enable this to happen a from to set up a meeting would be helpful!

idea 2: To leave a message, that will get sent to me!

idea3: A form to collect their information, so I can reach out to them!
  Again say william stubles upon my website, one of his goals is to get into contact with me and possibly set up a meeting to get to know. To best support this i could have a form that would allow william to almost register his socials with me, giving me the opportunity to reach out if I am interested. This will allow william the opportunity to simply leave his email and Ill do the work of contacting him with meeting times that would work for me!


### Refined Design: Content (Milestone 2)

This supports williams goal of discovering the person I am to see if I would be a good fit at the company aswell as see if my expertise or experience is sufficient for the role he is considering me for. This is done through the personal content aswell as the content to exhibit my academic success and work done so far


### Refined Design: Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Organize the content for the audience and identify possible pages for the content using **multiple iterations** of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** a explanation of your thought process for each iteration.
> **Please physically sort cards;** please don't try and do this digitally.
> **Refer to the persona by name.**

![cardsorting1](/public/images/cardsorting_2300.JPG)
in this iteration i have 4 pages. I organized my content based on the content that would fit well with eachother on each page. I ordered all the things i would like to present first on the home page together, this includes a headshot,technical skills, about me and backgroun information, and contact information. I then organized the rest of the content based on organization, grouping the things to show my skills on one page and my hobbies and extracuriculars on another page.  And finally a page to exhibit my personality and allow for more personalization.


![cardsorting2](/public/images/cardsorting2_2300.JPG)

In this iteration i decided to keep the 4 pages however i moved a couple of the individual content on each page around. For example i chose to move the form to allow william to contact me more easily since that is a major goal of them. I moved my work experience to the content that further demonstrates my technical skills. And moved my hobbies to my clubs and extractivities page





### Refined Design: Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- page 1: Home
- page 2: About me
- page 3: My Work
- page 4: My communities

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your persona.

these names provide a quick breif but informative synopsis of what my page will be about. home is home, about me will allow the william to get to learn at me more about me, my work exhibits my work and projects completed, my communities shows the different clubs, extracirciular and hobbies I am apart of.

### Refined Design: Design (Milestone 2)
> Refine the design of your site to address the goals of your persona.
> Include iterations of **sketches** for each page of the refined design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> Document your _entire_ design process. **Show your preliminary sketches and your final sketches.** **We want to see iteration!**
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**


![Home layout1](/public/images/IMG_5789.JPG)
- here i have nav at the top with my header1 of my name followed by a headshot of me, then you scroll to get the rest of the home content which is a flex row of about me and my technical skills, followed by contact information and form. This is the final design layout for my home site.
<!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
- William wants to first be introduced to me but it is also essential to william that he can flow through my site easily so the nav is on top and my headshop and name are displayed first. William is interested in my skills and so i display the languages i know on the home page including  a bit of interpersonlaization with  a discription about me. a goal of william is to contact me so I have the contact blocked center and colored to further highlight it!

![Home layout2](/public/images/IMG_5788.JPG)
-here i have the same begining layout as above with the nav header and headshot, the only difference is here i decided to implement the about, technical skills contact and contact form all as a flex row and flex col to make a 4x4 display of content. The main difference here is i seperated to contact form to be seperated from the contact information.

![About Me Layout](/public/images/IMG_5790.JPG)
- with in this page i decided to have the nav at the top with my thought process next followed by my inspirations. Next i have a flex row consisting of things i enjoy and places iv traveled with an image carousel next to it displaying the images of the things discussed, i end the page with my favorite quote from my favorite book. This is the final design for this page

<!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
William wants to gain an interpersonalization of me to put a face, personality and individual behind a name, my about me page allows me to do this! It includes fun facts about me and other personal information.

![Communities Layout1](/public/images/IMG_5792.JPG)
- this layout i have my clubs that i am in and my hobbies all stacked on top of one another in a flex column

![Communities Layout2](/public/images/IMG_5793.JPG)

- within this layout i have my clubs that i am involved in a 4x4 flex grid, with an img associated with each club above the clubs name and a discription of the club. at the very bottom i have my hobbies. This is the final design choice for this page.
<!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
- william is looking to understand if i have the experience to working on a team, this page allows him to see just that bvy showing him the different organizations and clubs i am involved in!

![My work layout 1](/public/images/IMG_5794.JPG)

- within this layout I have the nav bar at the top, followed by the coding classes I have completed. Followed by a list of all the projects I have completed with an image of each project next to the name. Followed by a flex-row of my acedemic honors and work experienced. This is the final design for this site.
<!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
Williams main goal is to gauage my experience and see if im qualified for this position, my works page allows william to seee the different projects I am working/have worked on. I start with the classes iv taken and my academic awards so william can first gauge my academic competence.

![My Work Layout2](/public/images/IMG_5797.JPG)
- within this layout I have my nav bar at the top of the page, followed by a flex-row of my coded/relative classes completed and my academic honors recieved. followed by  a 4x4 grid of the projects i completed with an image and name of each.

<!-- added pages during milestone 3 -->

![contactpage](/public/images/IMG_BC9B62A0130E-1.jpeg)
I have decided to create a contact page including an image and the form to contact me, since my website is for laptop an img would allow me to cover as much white space as possible, also makig the text easier to read for william. The image would allow personalization for william, and since one of his goals is to contact me, creating a whole page to do so is important.

![404pagenotfound](/public/images/IMG_797961CBEEE4-1.jpeg)
This is the sketch design for my 404 page not found page. This sketch shows that the navigation and theme of the pages will remian the same on the page, it will have a cute distressful img and a messge that will tell william that the page is not aviable and to use the neavgiaion to redirect. The img hopefully will allow william to distress as will the continued nav and page layout.


### Partial Plan (Milestone 2)
> Using your refined sketches, plan your site's partials.
> You may describe each partial or sketch it. It's up to you!
> Explain how you will customize at least 1 partial.
- I will implement a partial on my pages navigation and header. My navigaion and header stay relativelye the same amongst my pages.I can use the customization of the partial and echo classes to signify to change the page name in the h2 and to also signify to my user what page they are currently on
To do this i will create
- implememt a when active partial to customize the navigation to indicate what page you are currently on.
    <!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
  - this customization of navigation is seen as  name of the page you are on becomes bolded and moves sligtly higher aligned compared to other nav names, i choose this customization because I want a sleek professional look on the pages as it is going to be shown to william (possible employers)
- create varaibles for each page to echo
  <!-- - added from feedback of milestone2 -->
- another partial is for the title on each page:
- cusomization is also seen with the header1/ title changes on each page, for example, my communities header says "my communities" while about page header says "about me"...




## Milestone 2 Feedback Revisions (Milestone 3)
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 2 feedback

I built on my persona, refining his goal, including an image of him and i also updated my descriptions of my sketeches incorporating my persona. I also added another partial. I added the changes above with a comment stating its a revision for m2 feedback


## Form Design and Planning (Milestone 3)

### Refined Form Design (Milestone 3)
> Refine the design of your site's form to address the goals of your persona.
> Include iterations of **sketches** of the form and its confirmation message.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> **Refer to the persona by name.**
>
![sketchform1](/public/images/IMG_5814.JPG)

This form adresses Williams goal of contacting me, this enables him to leave me a message and his contact information so that i can also reach back out to him after his message, this allign with his goals of being in contact with me!

![sketchform2](/public/images/IMG_5813.JPG)

This form also adresses Williams goal of contacting me, this enables him to leave me a message and his contact information so that i can also reach back out to him after his message, this allign with his goals of being in contact with me! The only difference between this iteration and the last iteration is that this one also asks for the phone number, however after reviewing both choices i think the phone number is redudant infromation if i already ask for the email, and the email is more professional feature to ask for instead of a number!

![confirmationpage](/public/images/IMG_5812.JPG)

this is the confirmation page that would allow confirmation and afford to william that his message has been sent as well as what he sent, so in case he made a typo he can always resubmit another message. This confirms to william that he had contacted me.

![confirmation page](/public/images/IMG_382F35CE1B64-1.jpeg)
I have decided to update the confirmation page to include an image, since my website is for laptop an img would allow me to cover as much white space as possible, also makig the text easier to read for william, this is the sketch.



### Form Planning (Milestone 3)
> Will your form use a GET or POST request.
> Justify your decision as to why the request type is appropriate for the form.

my form will use POST becuase the form handles private information such as my possible employers email adress.


## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions (Final Submission)
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback

I did not get any feedback to change anything, thus no responsive actions have been done. I received all checks and "looks good" from milestone 3 and thus didnt have anything to update in response!


## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Routing (Final Submission)
> Plan your HTTP routing.
> List each route and the PHP file for each route.

| Route       | PHP File                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| /           | pages/index.php (or pages/index.php)|
| /contact    | pages/contacts.php                  |
|/communities | pages/communities.php               |
|/contact/confirmation| pages/contact-confirmation.php |
|/about       | pages/divein.php                    |
|/mywork      |pages/projects.php                   |

> Explain why these routes (URLs) are usable for your persona.
>
These are usuable becuase each is short concise and descriptive of the page they are going to! about me is about, my contact page is contact, and my contact confirmation would be /contact/confirmation affording my persona, William to know where he is and what action he took. All my URLs also best practices and consist of lowercases


### Refined Missing Resource Page (Milestone 3)
> Refine the design of your site's missing resource 404 page for your persona.
> Include iterations of **sketches** of the page.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> **Refer to the persona by name.**

![404pagenotfound](/public/images/IMG_797961CBEEE4-1.jpeg)
This is the sketch design for my 404 page not found page. This sketch shows that the navigation and theme of the pages will remian the same on the page, it will have a cute distressful img and a messge that will tell william that the page is not aviable and to use the neavgiaion to redirect. The img hopefully will allow william to distress as will the continued nav and page layout. For this layout if have the image centered and text underneath it centered aswell, this layout will allow the img to be the first impression william gets on this page, allowing the witty image to calm or possible destress william when his actions doenst work out. (this is the final design choice)

![404 pge iteration 2](/public/images/404img2.jpeg)
This sketch shows that the navigation and theme of the pages will remian the same on the page, it will have a cute distressful img and a messge that will tell william that the page is not aviable and to use the neavgiaion to redirect.The img hopefully will allow william to distress as will the continued nav and page layout. For this layout i have the image and the text flexed in a felx container in a row. This is done to make use of as much possible white space on the page as william will be viewing from a desktop view.

### Accessibility Audit (Final Submission)
> Tell us what issues you discovered during your accessibility audit.
> What do you do to improve the accessibility of your site?


home: 2 errors and 5 contrast errors
The contrast errors i got was with my navigation bar, that the colors werent contrasting well, to imporve this i went to coolor.co and used their contrast tester to find a color that constrasted well with my nav background color. The 2 errors were coming from my button saying that there was an empty link, this made me check my code and it turns out i forgot a closing a tag.

About: No errors

My Work: No errors

My Communities: No errors

Contact: 3 errors about missing form labels. To fix this i used my lecture notes and fixed the label and ID attribute witin my form labels.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!
I learned various things such as how to use php for partials for customizationand avoid redudancies aswell as how to customize for specific URLS and connecting a 404 page to my site. I thought this URL routing was super interesting!


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Grading: Mobile or Desktop (Final Submission)
> When we grade your final site, should we grade this with a mobile screen size or a desktop screen size?

 Desktop


### Grading: Partials (Final Submission)
> Clearly list each partial file and where you used it.

- partial 1: My navigation header it is used on every page within my site (about me,contact,home,mywork, and communities), including my 404page and confirmation page.
- partial 2: This is my header/title of each page. This changes the name of the header bar at the top of my page (underneath the navigation) depending on the title of the page.

> Which partials have customization? Explain how the customization looks in the browser.

- my navigation partial show the current page you are by making that navigation bold, and larger on the navigation bar. Its supposed to be a minimiliztic affordance that doesnt distract but also allows you to identify which page you are on
- the customization of my partial two is that depending on what page you are on it will echo out the current page title witin the header, also identifying which page you are currently on!
